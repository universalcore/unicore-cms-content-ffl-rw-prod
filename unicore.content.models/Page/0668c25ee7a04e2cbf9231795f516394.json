  "content": "Burning and scalding are among the most common causes of serious injury among\r\nyoung children. Burns often cause permanent scarring, and some are fatal. The\r\ngreat majority of these are preventable. \r\n\r\n**One of the most common types of\r\nburns is from direct contact with fires or flames or touching hot surfaces. To\r\nprevent this kind of burn:** \r\n\r\n* keep young children away from cooking fires,\r\nmatches, paraffin lamps, candles and flammable liquids such as paraffin and\r\nkerosene \r\n* put stoves on a flat, raised surface out of the reach of children \r\n* if an open cooking fire is used, make it on a raised mound of clay, not\r\ndirectly on the ground. A barrier of mud, bamboo or other material or a\r\nplaypen can also be used to keep young children out of reach of the cooking\r\nplace. \r\n* do not leave small children alone near fires or to tend fires or cook\r\n* keep children away from heaters, hot irons and other hot appliances \r\n* never leave a child alone in a room with a candle or fire burning. \r\n\r\n**Another major cause of burns is scalding from hot liquids or foods. To prevent scalds:** \r\n\r\n* turn the handles of all cooking pots away from the reach of children \r\n* keep hot foods and liquids in a safe place and out of children's reach \r\n* do not let children turn on the hot water tap in a bath or shower by themselves \r\n* keep the temperature of water heaters below a medium setting to prevent scalding if\r\nchildren turn on the hot water \r\n* teach children not to play rough around people with hot drinks or in the kitchen when meals are being prepared * never\r\nhold a child when having hot liquids or foods. \r\n\r\n**Children can get a serious shock or burn if they come in contact with electricity. To prevent shocks and\r\nburns:** \r\n\r\n* teach children never to put their fingers or other objects into\r\nelectric sockets \r\n* cover power sockets to prevent access \r\n* keep electric wires out of children's reach \r\n* cover bare electric wires, which are particularly\r\ndangerous, using insulating tape. \r\n\r\n*For first aid advice on cuts and wounds,\r\nrefer to the end of this chapter*\r\n\r\n",
