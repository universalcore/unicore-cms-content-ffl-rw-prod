  "content": "As children grow and become mobile they put everything in their mouths.\r\nThey can pick up germs more easily as they explore and discover the world\r\naround them. This makes it very important for parents and other caregivers\r\nto practice good hygiene, such as hand washing with soap. They also need\r\nto handle and prepare food properly, use safe water and keep the living\r\nenvironment clean. These practices are important to prevent diarrhoea and\r\nother illnesses and to protect a child\u2019s health.\r\n\r\nFoods should be served immediately after preparation and leftovers safely\r\nstored. Clean utensils and surfaces should be used to prepare and serve food.\r\nChildren should be fed with clean cups and bowls. Bottles and nipples/teats\r\nshould be avoided because they are difficult to keep clean.\r\n\r\nFive key ways to keep food safe are: keep it clean; separate raw and cooked\r\nfoods; cook food thoroughly; keep it at a safe temperature; and wash raw\r\nfood materials in safe water.\r\n\r\n(Refer to the Hygiene chapter for more information.) \r\n\r\n",
