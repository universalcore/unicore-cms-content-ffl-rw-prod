  "content": "Small amounts of iodine are essential for children\u2019s growth and development.\r\nIf a woman does not have enough iodine during pregnancy, her child is likely\r\nto be born with a mental disability or possibly a hearing or speech disability.\r\nIf the child does not get enough iodine during infancy and childhood, he or\r\nshe may have delayed physical, mental or cognitive development. Even mild\r\ndeficiency can reduce learning ability and lower intelligence.\r\n\r\nGoitre, an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland causing a swelling\r\nof the neck, is a sign of iodine missing in the diet. Iodine deficiency in early\r\npregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage or stillbirth.\r\n\r\nUsing iodized salt instead of ordinary salt provides pregnant women and children\r\nwith as much iodine as they need. Iodized salt is safe for the whole family and is\r\nthe only salt needed for all cooking. Families should be sure to buy only iodized\r\nsalt of good quality \u2013 properly marked and packaged. Mothers need to make sure\r\nthey consume only iodized salt before, during and after pregnancy. Mothers and\r\nfathers need to ensure that the salt consumed by their children is iodized.",
