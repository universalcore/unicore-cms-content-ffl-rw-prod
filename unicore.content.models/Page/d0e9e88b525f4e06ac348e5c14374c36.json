  "content": "One way young children explore their environment is by putting things in their\r\nmouths which might cause them to choke. Also, young children have difficulty\r\nchewing and swallowing some foods such as hard sweets that can cause them to\r\nchoke. \r\n\r\n**Parents or other caregivers should:** \r\n\r\n* keep play and sleeping areas\r\nfree of small objects such as buttons, beads, balloons, pen caps, coins, seeds\r\nand nuts \r\n* check new toys carefully before children play with them to make\r\nsure they have no loose or sharp pieces that could break and be swallowed by\r\nor hurt the child \r\n* never give young children foods they can choke on such as\r\ngroundnuts (peanuts), hard sweets or food with small bones or seeds \r\n* always supervise young children during meals, and cut or tear children's food into\r\nsmall pieces that can be easily chewed or swallowed. \r\n\r\nCoughing, gagging and\r\nhigh-pitched, noisy breathing or the inability to make any sound at all\r\nindicate breathing difficulty and possible choking. Parents and other\r\ncaregivers should suspect a child is choking when he or she suddenly has\r\ntrouble breathing, even if no one has seen the child put something into the\r\nmouth. \r\n\r\n*For first aid advice on choking, refer to the end of this\r\nchapter.*\r\n\r\n",
