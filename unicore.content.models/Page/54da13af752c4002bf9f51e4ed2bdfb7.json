  "content": "In the first six months, when a baby is most at risk, exclusive breastfeeding \r\nhelps to protect against diarrhoea and other common infections and gets the \r\nbaby off to a good start in life. \r\n\r\nAt 6 months of age, the child needs other foods and drinks in addition to \r\nbreastmilk. These provide energy, protein, vitamins and other nutrients \r\nneeded to support growth and development. \r\nA variety of foods \u2013 vegetables and fruits, meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy \r\nproducts \u2013 help to meet the child\u2019s nutrition needs. Breastfeeding for up to \r\ntwo years and beyond provides an important source of nutrients that protect \r\nagainst disease.\r\n\r\nIf soft, semi-solid or solid foods are introduced too late, the child may not be \r\ngetting the necessary nutrients. This can slow down growth and development. \r\n\r\nWhen introducing solid foods, it is important to start with soft, mushy foods \r\nand move gradually to more solid foods. The greater the variety of healthy \r\nfoods, the more balanced and nutritious the child\u2019s diet. \r\n\r\nThe consistency and variety of foods should be adapted to a child\u2019s \r\nrequirements and eating abilities. At 6 months of age infants can eat pureed \r\nor mashed foods, thick soups and porridges. By 8 months most infants \r\ncan also eat \u2018finger foods\u2019 (snacks that children can eat by themselves). By \r\n12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as the rest of \r\nthe family. \r\n\r\nParents or other caregivers should avoid giving foods that may cause choking, \r\nsuch as nuts, grapes and raw carrots and other foods that have a shape and/or \r\nconsistency that may cause them to become lodged in the child\u2019s throat.\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to meet all the child\u2019s nutrient requirements without a lot of \r\nfoods from animal sources. So it may be necessary to give the child fortified \r\nfoods or spreads or multiple vitamin and mineral supplements, such as \r\npowders, syrups or dissolvable tablets. A trained health worker can advise \r\nthe parent or other caregiver about foods that provide the most nutrients and \r\nwhich supplements to use.\r\n\r\n**Following are some nutritious foods for young children (older than six\r\nmonths) to eat:**\r\n\r\n\u25cf Staple foods, including cereals (rice, wheat, maize, millet, quinoa), roots\r\n(cassava, yam, potatoes) and starchy fruits (plantain and breadfruit).\r\n\r\n\u25cf High-protein foods, such as red meat, poultry, fish, liver and eggs (can be\r\ngiven as often as possible).\r\n\r\n\u25cf Dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, curds and dried milk (which can be\r\nmixed with other foods, such as cooked porridge). These are good choices\r\nin the second six months of a breastfed child\u2019s life. These are better\r\nchoices than raw milk, which is harder for the child to digest.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Green leafy and orange-coloured vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli,\r\nchard, carrots, pumpkins and sweet potatoes (which provide vitamins).\r\n\r\n\u25cf Pulses, such as chickpeas, lentils, cowpeas, black-eyed peas, kidney beans\r\nand lima beans (to add variety and provide protein, energy and some\r\niron).\r\n\r\n\u25cf Oils, especially rapeseed oil, soy oil, red palm oil, butter or margarine.\r\n\r\n\u25cf Seeds, including groundnut paste, other nut pastes and soaked or\r\ngerminated seeds, such as pumpkin, sunflower, melon or sesame seeds\r\n(for energy and some vitamins).\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to provide all the nutrients needed by young children in a\r\nvegetarian diet. This is because foods from animal sources provide key\r\nnutrients, such as iron. A child eating a vegetarian diet needs additional\r\nnutrients in the form of multiple vitamin tablets or powders, fortified spreads\r\nor nutrient-rich food supplements.\r\n\r\nIron from plant foods is generally not absorbed very well by the body.\r\nHowever, plant foods such as pulses (white beans, chickpeas, lentils) have\r\nmore iron. The iron will be better absorbed if eaten together with foods that\r\nare high in vitamin C, such as oranges and other citrus fruits and juices",
