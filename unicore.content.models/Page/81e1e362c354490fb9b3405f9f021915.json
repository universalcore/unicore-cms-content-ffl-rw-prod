  "content": "Parents should immediately seek help from a trained health worker if the\r\nchild: \r\n\r\n* passes several watery stools in an hour \r\n* passes blood in the stool \r\n* vomits frequently \r\n* has a fever \r\n* is extremely thirsty \r\n* does not want to drink \r\n* refuses to eat \r\n* has sunken eyes \r\n* looks weak or is lethargic \r\n* has had diarrhoea for several days. \r\n\r\nIf the child has any of these signs, help from\r\na trained health worker is needed urgently. In the meantime, the child should\r\nbe given ORS solution and/or other liquids, plus zinc. \r\n\r\nIf the child passes\r\nseveral watery stools in one hour and vomits, there is cause for alarm - these\r\nare possible signs of cholera. Cholera can kill children in a matter of hours.\r\nMedical help should be sought immediately and the child should continue to\r\nreceive ORS solution and zinc. \r\n\r\n* Cholera can spread throughout the community\r\nquickly through contaminated water or food. Cholera usually occurs in\r\nsituations where there is poor sanitation and overcrowding. \r\n\r\n**There are four steps to take to limit the spread of cholera or diarrhoea:**\r\n\r\n1. Always wash hands with soap and water or a substitute, such as ash and water, after\r\ndefecation, after contact with faeces, before touching or preparing food,\r\nbefore eating and before feeding children. \r\n2. Dispose of all faeces, including those of infants and young children, in a latrine or toilet, or bury\r\nthem. Disinfect the places touched by the faeces. \r\n3. Use safe drinking water. \r\n4. Wash, peel or cook all foods. \r\n\r\nTrained health workers and health\r\ncentres should provide families and communities with clear information on the\r\nrisks of diarrhoea and cholera and what steps to take when either one occurs.\r\n\r\n",
