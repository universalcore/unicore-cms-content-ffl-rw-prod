Household waste water can be disposed of safely by making a soak pit\r\nor a channel to the kitchen garden or to the field. \r\n\r\nChemicals such as pesticides and herbicides can be very dangerous if even small quantities get\r\ninto the water supply or onto food, hands or feet. Clothes and containers used\r\nwhen handling chemicals should not be washed near a household water source.\r\n\r\nPesticides and other chemicals should not be used around the household or near\r\na water source. Chemicals should not be stored in or near drinking water\r\ncontainers or near food. Never store food or water in pesticide or fertilizer\r\ncontainers.\r\n\r\n",
