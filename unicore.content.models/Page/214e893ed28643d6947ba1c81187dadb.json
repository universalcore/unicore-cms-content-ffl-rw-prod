  "content": "Drowning may cause brain injury or death. To prevent children from drowning,\r\nparents and other caregivers should always closely supervise children who are\r\nnear or in the water. \r\n\r\n**Where there is water, it is important to:** \r\n\r\n* cover wells and water tanks so children cannot open them \r\n* turn tubs and buckets\r\nupside down when not in use, and always supervise children taking a bath \r\n* teach children to stay away from ditches and drains \r\n* for families who live\r\nnear bodies of water, install a fence around the house and close the gates to\r\nprevent young children from going in the water \r\n* fence ponds and pools with\r\nvertical rails spaced close together to prevent children from getting through\r\nthem to the water \r\n* for families who live directly on the water, put vertical\r\nbars on terraces, windows and doors to prevent young children from falling in\r\nthe water \r\n* teach children how to swim when they are young \r\n* have young\r\nchildren and children who cannot swim wear an approved flotation device (life\r\njacket) when playing in the water or on a boat \r\n* always supervise children who\r\nare swimming \r\n* teach children never to swim in fast-flowing streams and never\r\nto swim alone \r\n* in flood-prone areas, carefully watch children when the water\r\nbegins to rise; make sure that all family members, including children old\r\nenough to understand, are well informed of safe places to go to if they need\r\nto leave the home quickly. \r\n\r\n*For first aid advice on cuts and wounds, refer to the end of this chapter*\r\n\r\n",
